# C-Trading-Platform

# Simplified Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform

Hi! 👋 I'm currently studying at university, and alongside my coursework, I’ve been teaching myself C++ to strengthen my programming skills. As part of that journey, I built this **simplified cryptocurrency exchange platform** as a personal project.

## 💡 About the Project

This project simulates the core functionality of a cryptocurrency trading platform. It’s completely written in C++, and my goal was to challenge myself by creating something more complex than simple console apps. Working on this helped me deepen my understanding of C++ programming, especially object-oriented design and modular code organization.

## 🛠️ Features

- User interaction through a text-based menu
- Simulated buying and selling of cryptocurrencies
- Basic order matching logic
- Account balance tracking
- Data structures to manage users, orders, and trades
- Modular code design using classes and separate source/header files

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I explored and practiced:
- Using control flow to handle user input and program logic
- Designing custom data types and structures to represent trades and user accounts
- Translating algorithms from pseudo-code to working C++ code
- Writing and organizing object-oriented code with classes
- Building a larger project from scratch and maintaining readable, reusable code

## 🚀 How to Run

To compile and run the program:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp tradingmain.cpp OrderBook.cpp OrderBookEntry.cpp -o tradingapp
./tradingapp
